# MicroPython for Raspberry pi pico   
This tutorial is based on the [C1K0001 4in1 basic learning kit](../../C1K0000_4in1_basic_learning_kit/C1K0000_4in1_basic_learning_kit.md).     

## Prepared knowledge    
**Learn about** [**Basic learning shield**](../../../arduino/A1E0000_basic_learning_shield/A1E0000_basic_learning_shield.md).  

**Learn about** [**3in1 basic learning shield**](../../../common_product/C1E0000_3in1_basic_learning_shield/C1E0000_3in1_basic_learning_shield.md).

Unzip the file downloaded above, and the file in the "**pico->python**" folder is the sample code.       


## Basic Example: Open a sample code and light an LED      
**Objective:**     
1. How to open the sample code.    
2. Verify that the pico motherboard works.      

**Demonstration:**       
Open the "**blink\.py**" file as follows:     

After running the code, the LED on the pico board lights up every 1 second:
