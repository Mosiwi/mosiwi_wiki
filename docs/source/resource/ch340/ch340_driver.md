If the driver is successfully installed, when the mainboard is connected to the computer through the USB cable, under the path **"Computer" -> "Properties" -> "Device manager"**, you can find **"USB-SERIAL CH340 (COM3)"**, as shown below:

## 3. Install the driver on your MAC system

## 4. Install the driver on your Linux system    
---------------------------------------------
Drivers are almost certainly built into your Linux kernel already and it will probably just work as soon as you plug it in.  If not you can download the Linux CH340 Driver (but I’d recommend just upgrading your Linux install so that you get the  “built in” one).  
If you must install it by yourself, check the <span style="color: rgb(255, 76, 65);">"README\.md"</span> file in the zip package.

## 5. Install the driver on your Android system     
-----------------------------------------------
Android drivers need to be developed by users. The compressed package provides sample code and development guidelines in both Chinese and English.
